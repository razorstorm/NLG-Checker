technicals:

jquery sends a get request to manga fox, then uses the jQuery() function to build a DOM element out of the returned html, then selects the top most chapter li element and grabs the date.

then grab current date, massage it into the same format, and compare the strings. If the two dates are different, output OLG.

I used https://github.com/padolsey/jQuery-Plugins/tree/master/cross-domain-ajax/
 
 to enable cross domain GET requests via javascript.
